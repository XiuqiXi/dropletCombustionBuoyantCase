# dropletCombustionBuoyantCase

This case includes the input files for DatareactingBuoyantFoam.

Some supplyments for the boundary conditions: The boundary conditions for pressure and velocity is the focus here. For the sides, the velocity is driven by the pressure and the total pressure is set to be 1e5 to these. And for the top, the outlet mass flux is given. The value of the constant mass flux is based on the injection mass flux from the interface boundary condition.
